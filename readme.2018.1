pascal-olin 3 files added, replacing the existing ones  â€¦
Changed to allow the installation on FlightGear 2018.1, added a file addon-metadata.xml describing the package, renamed (and changed slightly the files to config.xml to addon-config.xml and main.nas to addon-main.nas 
the installation simply requires that these files are present on an accessible directory e.g. C:\Users\<username>\Documents\FlightGear\AddOns\landing_rate\ and that the option  
"--addon="C:\Users\<username>\Documents\FlightGear\AddOns\landing_rate" is added to the additional Settings on the Settings tab of FG 2018.1
